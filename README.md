# Hi, I'm Lyle

QA Engineer with experience working across mobile, web and integrated systems.

## Core Focus

- API Testing
- Functional & Regression Testing
- Backend Web Development (Python / Django)
- Frontend Web Development (HMTL / CSS / Javascript)

## Projects

- **Rockdrop** – Django-based e-commerce web application (in progress)
